# matrixmagic


This repository contains Python (3.6.3) code to compare performance speeds for different methods of performing matrix operations.


Modules required:
 - numpy
 - matplotlib


It focuses on highlighting the performance benefits of performing scaler/vector operations on numpy matrices compared to traditional iterative or recursive techniques.

 - 'compare_basic.py' covers some rudimentary functions e.g addition, multiplication.

 - 'compare_complex.py' covers some more complex functions e.g converting RGB images to greyscale.
